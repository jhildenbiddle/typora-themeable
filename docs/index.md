**CDN**

This library is available on [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/typora-themeable) (below), [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/typora-themeable/), and other CDN services that auto-publish npm packages.

```css

This prevents breaking changes in future releases from affecting your project and is therefore the safest method of loading dependencies from a CDN. When a new major version is released, you will need to manually update your CDN URLs by changing the version number after the @ symbol.
